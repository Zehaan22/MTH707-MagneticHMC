## Codes for Magnetic HMC

The strcutre of this repository is as follows:

- Each example of the algorithm is stored in a sub directory with the name of the example, say "Toy Example".

- Within that directory, you will find two files:
	- Algorithm.R

	This file contains the actual implementation of the sampler or related parts of the algorithm.

	- RUNME.R

	This file contains a sample run of the algorithm mentioned before along with (hopefully) helpful visualisations 


The examples shown in this directory are:
- Toy Example: (Uni-variate Standard Normal Target)
