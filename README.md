# Magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

Hello fellow explorer!

This repositiry contains my implementation of Magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (MHMC). 
The aim of this project is to create a problem agnostic MCMC sampler guided by the principles of conformal Hamiltonian Dynamics and to remove the need for un-intuitive tuning paramaters. 

### Repository Structure:
- Code:

Directory with all the code implementations for all the algorithms and visualisations (all in R).

Within this repository, I have folders for all the targets and algorithms that I implement in this paper and their underlying structure and how to run them is explained in the README.md file in the folder.

- Papers:

Reference articles for the project.

- Images:
Images used to genreate the report.


- Reports:

Directory with theoretical doccumentation of the algorithms implemented in the project.

Hope you have fun with this read!
